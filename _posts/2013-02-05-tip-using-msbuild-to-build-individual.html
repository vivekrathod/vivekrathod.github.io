<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Some times its very annoying to run a full build to debug an issue with a particular project. To build just one project from a solution file you can do something like this<br /><pre class="csharpcode"></pre><pre class="csharpcode">msbuild solution_file.sln /t:<span class="str">"solution_folder\project_name"</span> /p:Configuration=Debug</pre><br />where ‘solution_folder’ is the solution folder under which the ‘project_name’ project is located<br /><br />There is another way, but that does not take into account the project dependencies (as they are defined in the solution file)<br /><pre class="csharpcode"></pre><pre class="csharpcode">msbuild path_to_project_file /t:Build /p:Configuration=Debug</pre></div>
