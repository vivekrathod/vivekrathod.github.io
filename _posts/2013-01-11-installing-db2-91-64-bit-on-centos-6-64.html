<p>Untar the installer</p> <p>tar xvf DB2_Enterprise_Svr_Ed_Linux_x86-64.tar<br></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>If you wish to do a graphic install and are connecting via a SSH client like ‘<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CD4QFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chiark.greenend.org.uk%2F~sgtatham%2Fputty%2F&amp;ei=uhnwUKq7IuPn0gGZ-YDQBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEtEh-zdWFiiosvMznjktZ3Wxpq-www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/" target="_blank">Putty’</a>, you need to install and configure a 'X' server like ‘<a href="http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/" target="_blank">Xming’</a>. Simply launch it listening on display 0.0 and turn off access control. On the remote server where we would start the setup, export ‘DISPLAY’ variable to point to your local machine  <p>export DISPLAY=local_machine_dns_name_or_ip:0.0  <p>Now if you run any X application it should open a screen on your machine. Try running ‘xclock’. If ‘xclock’ is not installed do  <p>yum install xclock  <p>Also, for simplicity (and assuming we are installing for development purposes) you may turn off the 'iptables' firewall to allow access to the DB2 database server we will install<br>service iptables stop<br>service iptables save  <p>If you followed the <a href="http://appseclink/sites/engineering/scanservices/blog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=87" target="_blank">instructions</a> for setting up the X server and have it listening for clients on your local machine, do this to redirect X applications </p> <p>export DISPLAY=machine_name:0.0</p> <p>The only extra dependency I had to install to run the DB2 setup was this</p> <p>yum install compat-libstdc++</p> <p>Now you can run </p> <p>./db2setup</p> <p>This should start the installer and open the window on your local machine. Choose default choices for all options - DB2 Administration server under user dasusr1, port 523, DB2 instance under db2inst1, port 50000 etc</p> <p>Once the setup is complete, login as db2inst1 and run</p> <p>db2start</p> <p>to start the server. To create a database run</p> <p>db2</p> <p>which gives you a prompt. Now you can create a sample database</p> <p>db2 =&gt; create database sample</p> <p>To test locally, simply connect to the sample database and you should see the below</p> <p>db2 =&gt; connect to sample</p> <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Database Connection Information</p> <p>Database server&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = DB2/LINUXX8664 9.1.0<br>SQL authorization ID&nbsp;&nbsp; = DB2INST1<br>Local database alias&nbsp;&nbsp; = SAMPLE</p> <p><font size="4"><strong></strong></font>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><font size="2">Connecting remotely</font></strong></p> <p>To test and connect remotely, install any DB2 client that includes ‘Command Line Processor’ (for example, <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24030302" target="_blank">DB2 9.5 Data Server Runtime Client</a>. Assuming ‘ganga’ is the hostname for our DB2 server listening on port 50000, catalog the node as ‘ganga_n’</p> <p>db2 =&gt; catalog tcpip node ganga_n remote ganga server 50000<br>DB20000I&nbsp; The CATALOG TCPIP NODE command completed successfully.<br>DB21056W&nbsp; Directory changes may not be effective until the directory cache is<br>refreshed.</p> <p>Assuming there is a ‘sample’ database on server catalog it locally as ‘ganga_s’ </p> <p>db2 =&gt; catalog database sample as ganga_s at node ganga<br>DB20000I&nbsp; The CATALOG DATABASE command completed successfully.<br>DB21056W&nbsp; Directory changes may not be effective until the directory cache is<br>refreshed.</p> <p>Now, you can connect to the remote ‘sample’ database. Assuming the instance was created as user ‘db2inst1’ (password ‘password) we can connect this way</p> <p>db2 =&gt; connect to ganga_s user db2inst1 using password</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Database Connection Information</p> <p>Database server&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = DB2/LINUXX8664 9.1.0<br>SQL authorization ID&nbsp;&nbsp; = DB2INST1<br>Local database alias&nbsp;&nbsp; = GANGA_S</p>
