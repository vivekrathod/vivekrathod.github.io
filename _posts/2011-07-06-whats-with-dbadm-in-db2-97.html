DB2 seems to have taken the 'separation of duties' principal to heart. This is really good from a security point of view. Starting with 9.7, the database administrator authority (DBADM), by itself, no longer has implicit access to DB2 data! It means, admins can no longer *see* sensitive data (this credit card nos..) stored in the database.<br/>Another authority called DATAACCESS was introduced which does have implicit access to data. When granting someone DBADM, the default is still to grant DATAACCESS, but this can be changed using<br/><pre style="padding-left: 40px;">GRANT DBADM WITHOUT DATAACCESS</pre><br/><p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
